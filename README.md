# guillemdiaz.github.io

This website is done entirely with html, css and a little of js. It took me 20 hours (just coding) 
to build it.<br>
The web page is quite complete but my intention is to add another project section (when I have
more of them) and to update the skills and the experience section when I acquire more. I also want
to add a color picker to change the main color of the web and some graphics with Three.js to 
give more dynamism.<br>
I have not included my resume because it seemed to me that it wasnt't going to add anything
else to what is already on the web, apart from the fact that it has personal information and this 
repository is public.

## How to use it
Just go to https://guillemdiaz.github.io/personal-website/ and and use the header to go to the 
different sections. The GD icon will take you back to the top.

## Information architecture
It is a one page website. I based my design on Brittany Chiang's website:
https://brittanychiang.com/#about

## Target audience
This website is for people who want to know more about me, my education, my work experience and my skills.
