# guillemdiaz.github.io

This website is done entirely with html, css and a little of js. It took me 20 hours (just coding) 
to build it.
The web page is quite complete but my intention is to add another project section (when I have
more of them) and to update the skills and the experience section when I acquire more.
I have not included my resume because it seemed to me that for the moment I would not add anything
else to what is already on the web, apart from the fact that it has personal information and this 
repository is public

## How to use it
Just go to https://guillemdiaz.github.io/personal-website/

## Information architecture
It is a one page website. I based my desing on Brittany Chiang's website:
https://brittanychiang.com/#about

## Target audience
This website is for people who want to know more about me, my education, my work experience and my skills
