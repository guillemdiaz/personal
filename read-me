I've based my design on this website by Brittany Chiang: https://brittanychiang.com/#about
The web page is quite complete but my intention is to add another project section 
(when I have more of them) and to update the skills and the experience section when I acquire more.
I have not included my resume because it seemed to me that for the moment I would not add anything
else to what is already on the web, apart from the fact that it has personal information and this 
repository is public
